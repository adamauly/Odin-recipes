        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Eggs come from chickens who are robbed daily of their
        unfertilized eggs. They can be prepared in various ways but the boiling has long been the 
        method of choice for wayward travelers and business people alike. It is naturally encolsed 
        in a protective casing, lending to its ease of transportation as it can easily be carried in pockets, 
        bags, purses etc.
        </p>
        <p>A perfectly boiled egg consists of an immaculately soft egg-white and a thick, creamy custard, it is therefore of
            utmost importance not to boil the eggs for too long lest the heat turns the yolk from a silky custard to a lumpy mess,
            or even worse a dry, crumbly nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>The egg needs to be started in a rolling boil, the reason being that this prevents the thin inner membrane of the egg from fusing 
            to the egg white. This will improve the final aesthetics of the egg and will wow all your guests. Another point on aesthetics pertains
            to the overall shape of the egg; the egg must have as perfect the shape of an oval as possible. The egg is generally prone to 
            forming a crater on its wide end. A simple course of action to mitigate this issue is to penetrate the shell of the egg with some
            sharp implement; why this works is because it relieves the pressure in the air sac, allowing the egg white to fill out the entirety of the shell
            during cooking.
        </p>
        <p>When the eggs are ready to be removed from the water the should ideally be placed in an ice bath to halt the cooking process. Alternatively it is permissible
            to simply place them under cool running water for 1-2 minutes. As soft-boiled eggs are quite soft, delicate hands are called for
            when peeling. Placing the eggs under a running faucet can aid in peeling as the water seeps between the membrane and the egg-white,

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pot with water such that it is able to fully submerge the egg</li>
            <li>Bring the water to a rolling boil</li>
            <li>Prick the wide end of the egg, taking care not to cause any crack in the shell</li>
            <li>Place the egg in the pot and set a timer to 6 minutes. Place the lid on and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer</li>
            <li>After 6 minutes remove the pot and either place the egg in an ice-bath or under cool running water</li>
            <li>To peel the egg, gently crack the shell and carefully remove the shell, avoiding tearing the egg-white</li>
