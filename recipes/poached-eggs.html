        <h2>Description</h2>
        Poached eggs is a dish made with eggs and very hot water. Eggs have a deceptively hard and chalky exterior, but for the diligent cook there awaits
        a sloppy surprise if they are able to break through the unappetising outer layer. The techniques involved in this dish include:
        <ul>
            <li>breaking through the outer barrier of the egg</li>
            <li>boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>crack the shell of the egg over a pot of simmering water</li>
            <li>See the recipe for <a href="./boiled-egg.html">boiled eggs</a></li>
        </ol>
